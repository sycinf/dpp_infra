The dse is structured as follows
./scripts ---- infrastructure script for constructing projects and running them
./tests   ---- benchmarks/test circuits compiled
   under each benchmark, there is a xml file describing the things need to be done
   for generating that particular benchmark, realize the input is always a bunch of
   c files
   in the case of a naive implementation, the benchmark describes path to the benchmarked
   function, the initialization stub
